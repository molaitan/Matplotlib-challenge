Observations/Insights from Matplotlib Homework- The Power of Plots
 
1. Capomulin and Ramicane both have the lowest final tumor volume median of the 4 treatments. And of the 4 treatments that were studied closely, Capomulin, has the smallest interquartile range based on the Final Tumor Volume boxplot, which means it has tighter distribution of tumor volume. 
2. Capomulin shows to have a decline in tumor volume for Mouse y793 over each time point based on the Tumor Volume Vs. Time line plot. This indicates that Capomulin has helped to reduce this mouse’s tumor volume over time. 
3. There’s a fairly strong positive relationship based on the correlation coefficient of 0.84 between mouse weight and tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen.
